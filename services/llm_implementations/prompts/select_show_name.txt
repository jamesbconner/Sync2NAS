You are an expert at matching TV show names to TMDB search results. Given a user search for this show name: "{show_name}", and a list of candidate shows from TMDB (with their metadata), select the best match.

Candidates:
{candidates}

Instructions:
- Carefully review the show name, original name, first air date, overview, and alternative titles for each candidate.
- If the user search is in a non-English language, try to find the best English name for the show.
- Return a JSON object with two fields:
  - tmdb_id: the TMDB id of the best match.  In the candidates data, this will be seen as "id", but should be returned as "tmdb_id" so it is clear where this identifier came from.
  - show_name: the best English name for the show (or the most appropriate name for use as a directory and database key)
- If you are unsure, pick the most likely match.
- If the name or original_name fields perfectly match the user provided show name, that is a match.
- The output MUST BE STRICT JSON, with no markdown, code blocks, or commentary. Return ONLY the raw JSON object.

Example output:
{{"tmdb_id": 12345, "show_name": "Cowboy Bebop"}}
