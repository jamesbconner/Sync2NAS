Suggest a short, human-readable directory name (max {max_length} characters) for the following long directory name. Avoid special characters and keep it unique and recognizable. Return only the name, no commentary.

Rules:
The directory name represents the title of a show. If there is a season number in the original filename, always include it in the directory name in the format of 'S1', 'S2', etc.
If there is no season number, but there is a year, include that in the directory name in the format of '2024', '2025', etc.
The season number or year should be the last part of the directory name if available.
Do not make up words for the directory name.
It is valid to use CamelCase for the directory name if the max_length is less than 50 characters.
Long name: {long_name}
